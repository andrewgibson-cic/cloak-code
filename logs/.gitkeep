# Logs Directory

This directory contains persistent logs from the CloakCode containers.

## Log Files

- `agent_activity.log` - Agent container activity (npm, git, pip commands)
- `proxy_injections.log` - Credential injection events from proxy
- `security_events.log` - Security-related events (blocks, violations)
- `audit.json` - Structured audit trail in JSON format

## Accessing Logs

```bash
# View agent activity
tail -f logs/agent_activity.log

# View proxy injections
tail -f logs/proxy_injections.log

# View security events
tail -f logs/security_events.log

# Search for specific events
grep "npm install" logs/agent_activity.log

# View structured audit log
cat logs/audit.json | jq
```

## Log Rotation

Logs are automatically rotated when they exceed 50MB.
Old logs are compressed and kept for 30 days.

## Persistence

These logs persist across container restarts and removals.
They are stored on the host filesystem and survive `docker-compose down`.
